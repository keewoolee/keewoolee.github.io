[[Curriculum Vitae]](/assets/pdf/CV_KeewooLee.pdf){:target="\_blank"}

I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher studying cryptography at UC Berkeley, hosted by [Prof. Sanjam Garg](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sanjamg/){:target="\_blank"}. In the meantime, I am working as a freelancer at [CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.co.kr/en/home/){:target="\_blank"}, a homomorphic encryption startup. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences at [Seoul National University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/){:target="\_blank"}. 

I am broadly interested in cryptography from theory to practice. Currently, my research focus is on cryptographic primitives for secure computation (e.g., [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption){:target="\_blank"}, [secure multiparty computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation){:target="\_blank"}) and their applications (e.g., privacy-preserving machine learning).
